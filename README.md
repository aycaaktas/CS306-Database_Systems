# CS306-Database_Systems
Group Project for CS306 Database Systems course in SabancÄ± University.

# About the Project

Database management system in order to help the Olympic games committee to regulate the Olympic games. Our database management stores information about the following entities; countries, athletes, managers, coaches,  jury,  medical service, technical service, transportation, audience, venue, and competitions. When a member of the Olympic committee enters the interface of our database, they will be able to reach out to every piece of the required information. Additionally, we display the relationships between these entities and their attributes. 

While creating our database management system we used MySQL.  As a web hosting service, phpMyAdmin is used and for the last part of the project, live messaging page for client support, Firebase is used. Further details about the project can be found in the reports shared in Github. And we also used SQL language to create and communicate with the database. For creating the interface (website) of our Database Management System and linking the Database with the interface we used PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal was to showcase the changes that will happen to the Database when the admin manages the Database through the interface.
